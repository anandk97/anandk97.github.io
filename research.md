## Research

My research revolves around developing advanced computational methods and data-driven strategies to tackle complex engineering challenges. Below are some of my key projects:

### Discrepancy Modeling for Airplane Fuselage Shape Control (January 2024 – Present)

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model for composite fuselage deflection under load to ensure precise alignment during assembly.
- **Approach:** Integrate high-fidelity measurement data with finite element predictions and employ physics-informed machine learning trained on limited experimental data.
- **Outcome:** Achieve uncertainty quantification and optimize actuator quantity and placement for enhanced model efficiency.

### Data-Driven Risk Assessment of Complex Hand-Intensive Manufacturing (June 2021 – Present)

- **Objective:** Engineer a multi-modal sensing testbed to capture synchronized upper body and hand poses, along with precise hand force measurements.
- **Approach:** Construct a comprehensive force-motion dataset (314 variables at 60Hz) and implement gradient boosting classifiers along with GRU models.
- **Outcome:** Automate ergonomic scoring with strong generalization (> 95% accuracy) and develop a novel ergonomic score (BACH) for detailed injury risk assessment.

### Control of Vortex Dynamics using Invariants (June 2021 – September 2023)

- **Objective:** Use Model Predictive Control to manage the evolution of vortices via ‘virtual cylinders’.
- **Approach:** Create visualizations and perform evaluations to compare controlled versus uncontrolled flow dynamics.

### Control of Microswimmer in Turbulent Flow using Reinforcement Learning (June 2020 – Present)

- **Objective:** Develop ‘smart’ microswimmers capable of efficiently navigating turbulent flows toward designated targets.
- **Approach:** Employ deep neural networks with iterative interactions to minimize energy usage and travel time.
- **Outcome:** Achieve up to 2× faster target acquisition and significant energy savings compared to naive strategies.

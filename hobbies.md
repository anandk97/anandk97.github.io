## Hobbies

While my professional and academic life is both busy and rewarding, I also believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Although my CV does not detail my personal hobbies, I enjoy exploring creative and recreational pursuits in my free time. 

Whether it's discovering local art, experimenting with photography, or enjoying outdoor adventures, I look forward to sharing more about my personal interests here in the future.

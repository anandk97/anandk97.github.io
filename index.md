# Welcome to My Website!

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate (graduating June 2025) at the University of Washington specializing in data-driven control and optimizations. My work focuses on multimodal data collection, physics-based modeling, and advancing efficient manufacturing. I am passionate about integrating data-driven algorithms into engineering contexts and engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations that combine engineering insights with state-of-the-art computational techniques.
